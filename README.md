### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Mariam Fathi

I'm a **network systems engineer** who transitioned into the world of software development.  
After completing several programming courses, I decided to explore the broader IT field and pursue my passion for coding.

Being self-taught is a challenge, but it's also rewarding. I started learning from various resources like YouTube channels, The Odin Project, and others.  
Eventually, I discovered **Mohamed Abou-Hadhoud's roadmap**, which is clear, well-organized, and straight to the point.

I began with **C++ basics** and a lot of **problem-solving**, and now I've moved into **C# development** â€” and I'm on my way! ðŸš€

ðŸŒ± Currently learning: C#, object-oriented programming, Windows Forms  
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Become a well-rounded developer with strong fundamentals  
ðŸ’» Background: Linux, networking, virtualization, Kubernetes

Thanks for visiting my profile!
